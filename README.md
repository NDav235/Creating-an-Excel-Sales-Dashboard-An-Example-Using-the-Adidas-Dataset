## Overview
The dataset used in this project contains sales transaction records for Adidas products between 2020 and 2021. Daily sales transactions from different U.S. stores, locations, and product groups were used in the dataset.
## Column Description

- Retailer: Name of the retailer (e.g., Foot Locker, Walmart)
- Retailer ID: Numeric identifier for the retailer
- Date: Date of the transaction
- Region: Regional sales location (e.g., Northeast)
- State: U.S. state (e.g., New York)
- City: City where the sale occurred
- Product: Description of the product type (e.g., Men’s Street Footwear)
- Unit Price: Price per unit of product sold
- Units Sold: Total number of units sold
- Total Sales: Revenue generated from the sale
- Operating Profit: Profit after subtracting operating costs
- Operating Margin: Percentage of revenue that is profit Sales
- Channel: Where the product was sold (e.g., In-store, Outlet)
## Objective of the Project
To analyze Adidas sales performance across the US by retailer, region, product, and sales method, to identify growth opportunities and improve profitability.
## Tools and techniques used 

- Cleaning and Changing Data: This means fixing the date format, making text look the same, and creating new columns like months and days of the week.
- Pivot Tables: These help to quickly group and compare data from different categories.
- Slicers: These are buttons that let users easily filter the data by product, region, store, or sales method.
- Charts and KPIs: These are used to show trends in the data and point out important numbers like profits or sales performance.
## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning started at this point:
1. Filtered and eliminated any rows that were empty or blank.
2. To facilitate management, the dataset was converted into a table.
3. Verified consistency and looked for any missing data.
4. Two new columns were created: Day of the Week and Month
correctly formatted numbers and currency
5. The invoice date column was changed to a short date format.
## Observations:
1. Men’s footwear categories dominate, while Women’s Athletic Footwear lags significantly, indicating a potential focus area for marketing or product improvement.
2. Sales peak in summer (July-August) and again in December. Strategic promotions in low-performing months like March and October could help even out revenue.
3. The company has a well-distributed, multi-channel sales strategy. While physical “In-store” sales are the primary driver, the “Online” channel is a very close and significant second, indicating a strong e-commerce presence.
4. The West region is the company’s most lucrative market. There is a clear descending order of sales performance from West to Midwest.
5. “West Gear” and “Foot Locker” are the most critical retail partners, accounting for a substantial portion of retailer-driven sales. There is a notable drop in sales volume after the top three retailers.
6. Women’s products are more profitable, showing higher operating margins across all categories, while Men’s Street Footwear, despite being the best-selling category, has the lowest profit margin — indicating it generates high revenue but contributes less to overall profit.
7. Charleston and New York lead city-level sales, contributing significantly to overall revenue; surprisingly, Charleston surpasses even New York despite its smaller population, indicating strong brand engagement or particularly effective retail partnerships in that market.
